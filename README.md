dragon curve exercise
=====================
This project contains a starter script for 
writing a dragon curve fractal (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve and http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DragonCurve.html)
with the curses api (see http://docs.python.org/2/library/curses.html) 
in python.

The initial version of this script simply prints
dots randomly to the screen.


`make dragon` will run the program
`make clean` will clean up the *.pyc and *.log files
