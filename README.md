dragon curve exercise
=====================
This project contains a starter script for 
writing a dragon curve fractal with the curses
api in python.

The initial version of this script simply prints
dots randomly to the screen.


`make dragon` will run the program
`make clean` will clean up the *.pyc and *.log files
